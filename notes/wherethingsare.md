These are notes on where I need to find things to help me reconstruct when trees were planted and when they were collected. 

#### plants in raised beds from 2015 season
wildhellgarden/analyses/input/Commongardenspeciesrequirements_Mar2016.csv
15 BETPOP in 2016 March
0 BETPAP
0 BETALL
30 ALNINC

The fact that in the spring and fall of 2016, there was no BETPAP nor BETALL in raise beds may suggest that they are one GS behing BEPOP and ALNINC

###Climate data

To verify if the trees were harvested in the spring of fall, I can check the pictures Lizzie posted on the teams, because they were taken in March. Therefore these would be for sure harvested in march.
