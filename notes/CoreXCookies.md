### Notes on year matching with cores
Since we don't know when cookies were collected, but we know with confidence that all cores were collected in May 2023, I am using cores to determine the last ring of the cookies

### ALNINC GR8B P5
Dont know verify with microscope.
Measured, not super confident and missing knot and first growth years.

### ALNINC HF8 P12
No cookies. Missing pit and first year growth

### ALNINC HF9 P6
No cookies TO CHECK. It's currently entered in the excel sheet, but it was not scanned. So I should check all the cookies physicaly. 

### ALNINC SH1 P12
Outer ring 2022. Really not sure of most of the outer rings. To check for the year patterns in R

### ALNINC_SH6_P5
No cookies. Really not sure of outer rings. Potential false rings. MICROSCOPE.

###ALNINC_WM2B_P1_guides
No cookies TO CHECK. My excel says I have a cookie, but I don't in the scanned ones...

## BETALL 

###BETAL_GR9_P3_guides
Confident that it matches the cookie year. Thus outer ring 2023. MICROSCOPE AND REFINE SANDING to make sure outer ring is 2023.  

#### BETALL_GR9_P3_guides.tif
TO CHECK two betall gr9 p3. The one above matches the cookie pretty well.

### BETALL GR12 P1
Outer ring 2023. Fit well the core.
### BETALL_GR13_P1_guides
No cookies TO CHECK. I entered it in excel as if I have a cookie. 
### BETALL_GR13_P2_guides
No cookies TO CHECK.
Core first ring is HUGE. MICROSCOPE TO verify. Missing pit on the scan, but might not be missing physically. 
### BETALL SH2 P6
 Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Needs to be updated in r so 22 becomes 23
### BETALL SH4 P3
Doesnt add up. TO Microscope.
### BETALL_SH4A_P9_guides
No cookies. Measured and includes pit. Confident
### BETALL_SH5_P6
Look up in R the ring width. There is differences between the years when I compare core vs cookie. Its likely that last ring is 2023. 
### BETALL WM 8 P1
Confident that last ring is 2023. No csv in R because the rings are so weird and 2 knots!
### BETALL SH9 PNA
Very likely to be P9. TO CHECK 
If it's SH9 P9, THEN BETALL SH9 P9 outer ring is 2023.\
### BETALL WM8 P9
No cookies.
Very strange. It seems like one side of the core started growing while the other didnt... look patern to other cores and MICROSCOPE.
### BETALL WM 8 P12
TO CHECK core doesn't exist. 
### BETALL_WM8A_P12_guides
ALREADY changed years to correct ones. Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. 
### BETALL_WM8A_P5_guides_1
Outer ring 2023. Confident. 
### BETALL_WM8B_P95_guides
TO CHECK : the name because 95 doesnt exist.
### Core BETALL WM9 P5
There is a cookie, but I don't have guidelines for it, I don't know why. TO DO : ADD GUIDELINES to cookie
Cookie most likely collected in the fall so last ring would be 2023

## BETPAP
### Core BETPAP HF16 P2 
TO check no cookie. 
RESCAN if there is two sides around the pit. 
### BETPAP HF16 P12
Outer ring 2023. Fit well the core. Good demonstration in case of need.
### BETPAP HF16A P6
Outer ring 2023. Fit well the core. Good demonstration in case of need. Ask **Neil **if the false ring could be early 2023, or late 2022.
### BETPAP SH1A P1 
Outer ring 2023. Fit well the core.

## BETPOP 
### BETPOP GR3 P16
TO CHECK: doesn't match the cookie at all. Waay smaller than cookie and ring patterns don't match.
### BETPOP GR5 P1
Outer ring 2022. Fit well the core.
### BETPOP GR5 P6
MICROSCOPE: look the cookie last ring. It matches well the last ring of the core, but it could also mean that it started growing already in early 2023. However, at some places, the outer ring of the cookie is well defined, so it's hard to tell. 
### BETPOP GR5A P3
ALREADY changed years to correct ones. Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. 
### BETPOP GR5A P12
Outer ring 2023. Fit well the core.
### BETPOP GR5B P3
ALREADY changed years to correct ones. Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. 
### Core BETPOP GRB P12 --> PROBABLY fit GR5B P12
Outer ring 2023 of cookie BETPOP GR_5B_P12. Fit well the core.
### BETPOP HF1 P2
ALREADY changed years to correct ones. Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. 
### BETPOP HF1 P3
Look up MICROSCOPE the core. Missing the outer ring of one side of the core which limits interpretion. 
### BETPOP HF3A P6
Might fit core HF3B P6... Not sure though. However the ring patterns match really well the cookie. EXCEPT the core has a very narrow outer ring which the cookie doesn't. It's usually the opposite. This would mean that the core was harvested below the cookie. I need to figure out first if that core fits that cookie. 

Look for the cookie HF3B because I entered it as I have a cookie. I have one that has never been scaned before that is only HF P6...
### BETPOP hf5 p6
No cookie. Not super confident, to check in R with the patterns of the other cookies/cores. For now, its in confident
### BETPOP WM7_P2 
 I have a cookie, but I overwrote it with the zip. I will re-add guidelines, but for now I verified the rings by comparing it with the core and it seems like the outer ring would be 2023 growth. HOWEVER Double check with microscope that the last bit of the outer ring I am missing, doesn't have another that follows it. 

### BETPOP_WM7_P3
ALREADY changed years to correct ones. Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. 
 
### BETPOP WM7 P6
 Outer ring 2023. Fit well the core.
 
### BETPOP WM7 P9
Pretty confident that the outer ring is 2023. It matches the core well, except for the most inner rings. My hypothesis for this is the cookies were harvested right above root colar, so there are more rings, and they are wider than for the core. 
ALREADY changed years to correct ones. Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. 

### BETPOP_WM8_P15
TO check no cookie. 
It's in the excel, so I should check it. May be WM 8 PNA!
### BETPOP_XX_P3
 Outer ring 2023. Fit well the core.
