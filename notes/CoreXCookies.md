### Notes on year matching with cores
Since we don't know when cookies were collected, but we know with confidence that all cores were collected in May 2023, I am using cores to determine the last ring of the cookies

### ALNINC GR8B P5
Dont know verify with microscope.
Measured, not super confident and missing knot and first growth years.
Super confusing, the ring width patterns dont match, plus what appears to be 2023 growth is only present on one side of the cookie... Cannot add this to the data with confidence for now. Both cookie and core moved to not confident.

### ALNINC HF8 P12 
No cookies. Missing pit and first year growth. Measured and confident. 

### ALNINC HF9 P6
No cookies. 
### ALNINC SH1 P12
Outer ring 2022. Really not sure of most of the outer rings. To check for the year patterns in R

### ALNINC_SH6_P5
No cookies. Really not sure of outer rings. Potential false rings. MICROSCOPE.

###ALNINC_WM2B_P1_guides
No cookies. RESCAN

## BETALL 

###BETAL_GR9_P3_guides
Two cores for the same tree.
Really unsure of the ring patterns, especially the outer ones. Missing first growth year.
###BETAL_GR9_P3_guides
Probably cored the same tree twice, as the ring patterns matched, but I am still very unsure of the calls. 
### BETALL GR12 P1
Outer ring 2023. Fit well the core.
### BETALL_GR13_P1_guides
No cookies. Measured and confident.
### BETALL_GR13_P2_guides
ALREADY changed years to correct ones. Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. 
### BETALL SH2 P6
 Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Needs to be updated in r so 22 becomes 23
### BETALL SH4 P3
TO Double check, but cookie and core are similar in diameter, but the cookie has very wider rings for the first years. The core is slightly larger in diameter, which doesnt make sens...
### BETALL_SH4A_P9_guides
No cookies. Measured and includes pit. Confident
### BETALL_SH5_P6
Problem fixed: it's not SH5, BUT SH9 P6. 
Crossdated with cookie SH9 P6

### BETALL WM 8 P1
Confident that last ring is 2023. No csv in R because the rings are so weird and 2 knots!
### BETALL SH9 PNA
Very likely to be P9. TO CHECK 
If it's SH9 P9, THEN BETALL SH9 P9 outer ring is 2023.
### BETALL WM8 P9
No cookies.
Very strange. It seems like one side of the core started growing while the other didnt... look patern to other cores and MICROSCOPE. Hypothesis: missing bark+ 2022 growth on one side of the core. 
### BETALL WM 8 P12
Changed name to WM8B P12.
ALREADY changed years to correct ones (talking about the cookie of WM8B P13...). Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. 
### BETALL_WM8A_P12_guides
ALREADY changed years to correct ones. Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. 
### BETALL_WM8A_P5_guides_1
Outer ring 2023. Confident. 
### BETALL_WM8B_P95_guides
TO CHECK : the name because 95 doesnt exist. Most probably WM8D P5 BECAUSE WM8 P9 has already a core. To measure by comparing it at WM8D P5, which is not 8D, but 8B.
Decision:
1. Changed cookie name WM8D P5 --> WM8B P5
2. Change core name WM8B P95 -->WM8B P5
3. Years are changed on the cookie so nothing to do there. 

### Core BETALL WM9 P5
Cookie most likely collected in the fall so last ring would be 2023. To confirm, but if it's the case, then ALREADY changed years to correct ones. Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. 

## BETPAP
### Core BETPAP HF16 P2 
RESCAN if there is two sides around the pit. 
### BETPAP HF16 P12
Outer ring 2023. Fit well the core. Good demonstration in case of need. Not the best though
### BETPAP HF16A P6
Outer ring 2023. Fit well the core. Good demonstration in case of need. Ask **Neil **if the false ring could be early 2023, or late 2022.
### BETPAP SH1A P1 
Outer ring 2023. Fit well the core. Missing the last bit of one of the 2022 ring width but have the other years except the pit and the ones around it. 

## BETPOP 
### BETPOP GR3 P16
TO DO: measure cookie and check with core. Desn't match the cookie at all. Waay smaller than cookie and ring patterns don't match. After looking at the cookie, maybe 2023 the tree grew a lot and core was taken much higher than normal. In any case, the tags match, its just the size for now. 
### BETPOP GR5 P1
Outer ring 2022. Fit well the core.

### BETPOP GR5 P6
MICROSCOPE: look the cookie last ring. It matches well the last ring of the core, but it could also mean that it started growing already in early 2023. However, at some places, the outer ring of the cookie is well defined, so it's hard to tell.

### BETPOP GR5A P3
ALREADY changed years to correct ones. Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. There is potentially 2 and 3 false rings within 2022... it could be an early 2023 that has stoped also. 
### BETPOP GR5A P12
Outer ring 2023. Fit well the core. One of the core side is missing a bunch of rings or are weirdly shaped but patterns are easily distinguishable. 
### BETPOP GR5B P3
ALREADY changed years to correct ones. Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. The rings are weird, like if this tree was very stressed the years 20, 21 and 22...
### Core BETPOP GRB P12 --> PROBABLY fit GR5B P12
Outer ring 2023 of cookie BETPOP GR_5B_P12. Fit well the core.
### BETPOP HF1 P2
ALREADY changed years to correct ones. Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. 
### BETPOP HF1 P3
Outer ring 2023. Fit well the core. Core is missing the pit (first year) and a little of 2022, but doesnt affect interpretation. 
### BETPOP HF3B P6
ALREADY changed years to correct ones. Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. 
The core has a very narrow outer ring that the cookie doesn't. It's usually the opposite. This would mean that the core was harvested below the cookie. 
### BETPOP hf5 p6
No cookie. Not super confident, to check in R with the patterns of the other cookies/cores. For now, its in confident
### BETPOP WM7_P2 
ALREADY changed years to correct ones. Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. 

### BETPOP_WM7_P3
ALREADY changed years to correct ones. Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. 
 
### BETPOP WM7 P6
 Outer ring 2023. Fit well the core.
 
### BETPOP WM7 P9
Pretty confident that the outer ring is 2023. It matches the core well, except for the most inner rings. My hypothesis for this is the cookies were harvested right above root colar, so there are more rings, and they are wider than for the core. 
ALREADY changed years to correct ones. Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. 

### BETPOP_WM8_P15
ALREADY changed years to correct ones. Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. 

It appears that for one of the guideline, the 2020 ring never grew.... For that one, I input it as 0 but to be more consistent I should input it as a false ring, but it would screw up the whole pattern. CHECK WITH NEIL
It's in the excel, so I should check it. May be WM 8 PNA!
### BETPOP_XX_P3
 Outer ring 2023. Fit well the core. TO CHANGE IN R
