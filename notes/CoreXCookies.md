### Notes on year matching with cores
Since we don't know when cookies were collected, but we know with confidence that all cores were collected in May 2023, I am using cores to determine the last ring of the cookies

### ALNINC GR8B P5
Dont know verify with microscope.

### ALNINC HF8 P12
No cookies TO CHECK

### ALNINC HF9 P6
No cookies TO CHECK

### ALNINC SH1 P12
Outer ring 2022

### ALNINC_SH6_P5
No cookies TO CHECK

###ALNINC_WM2B_P1_guides
No cookies TO CHECK
###BETAL_GR9_P3_guides
Confident that it matches the cookie year. Thus outer ring 2022. 

#### BETALL_GR9_P3_guides.tif
TO CHECK two betall gr9 p3. The one above matches the cookie pretty well.
### BETALL GR12 P1
Outer ring 2023. Fit well the core.
### BETALL_GR13_P1_guides
No cookies TO CHECK
### BETALL_GR13_P2_guides
No cookies TO CHECK
### BETALL SH2 P6
ALREADY changed years to correct ones. Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. 
### BETALL SH4 P3
Doesnt add up. TO Microscope.
### BETALL_SH4A_P9_guides
No cookies TO CHECK
### BETALL_SH5_P6
Look up in R the ring width. There is differences between the years when I compare core vs cookie. Its likely that last ring is 2023. 
### BETALL WM 8 P1
Confident that last ring is 2023. 
### BETALL SH9 PNA
Very likely to be P9. TO CHECK 
If it's SH9 P9, THEN BETALL SH9 P9 outer ring is 2023.\
### BETALL WM8 P9
TO check: wm8 p9 core is likely to be P1 as there is no p9 cookie. 
### BETALL_WM8A_P12_guides
Likely corresponds to Core WM8 P12 TO CHECK what core fits it as the ring patterns really dont match.
### BETALL_WM8A_P5_guides_1
Outer ring 2023. Confident. 
### Core BETALL WM9 P5
TO check no cookie. 
### Core BETPAP HF16 P2 
TO check no cookie. 
### BETPAP HF16 P12
Outer ring 2023. Fit well the core. Good demonstration in case of need.
### BETPAP HF16A P6
Outer ring 2023. Fit well the core. Good demonstration in case of need. Ask **Neil **if the false ring could be early 2023, or late 2022.
### BETPAP SH1A P1 
Outer ring 2023. Fit well the core.
### BETPOP GR3 P16
To check: doesn't match the cookie at all. Waay smaller than cookie and ring patterns don't match.
### BETPOP GR5 P1
*Outer ring 2022. Fit well the core. *
### BETPOP GR5 P6
MICROSCOPE: look the cookie last ring. It matches well the last ring of the core, but it could also mean that it started growing already in early 2023. However, at some places, the outer ring of the cookie is well defined, so it's hard to tell. 
### BETPOP GR5A P3
ALREADY changed years to correct ones. Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. 
### BETPOP GR5A P12
Outer ring 2023. Fit well the core.
### BETPOP GR5B P3
ALREADY changed years to correct ones. Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. 
### Core BETPOP GRB P12 --> PROBABLY fit GR5B P12
Outer ring 2023 of cookie BETPOP GR_5B_P12. Fit well the core.
### BETPOP HF1 P2
ALREADY changed years to correct ones. Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. 
### BETPOP HF1 P3
Look up microscope the core. Missing the outer ring of one side of the core which limits interpretion. 
### BETPOP HF3A P6
Might fit core HF3B P6... Not sure though. However the ring patterns match really well the cookie. EXCEPT the core has a very narrow outer ring which the cookie doesn't. It's usually the opposite. This would mean that the core was harvested below the cookie. I need to figure out first if that core fits that cookie. 
### BETPOP hf5 p6
TO check no cookie. 
### WM7_P2 
 I have a cookie, but I overwrote it with the zip. I will readd guidelines, but for now I verified the rings by comparing it with the core and it seems like the outer ring would be 2023 growth. HOWEVER Double check with microscope that the last bit of the outer ring I am missing, doesn't have another that follows it. 

### BETPOP_WM7_P3
ALREADY changed years to correct ones. Outer is 2023. Pretty confident. Csv is updated so nothing to do with this cookie. 
 
### BETPOP WM7 P6
 Outer ring 2023. Fit well the core.
 
### BETPOP WM7 P9
Check with microscope. I screwed up the scan.

### BETPOP_WM8_P15
TO check no cookie. 

### BETPOP_XX_P3
 Outer ring 2023. Fit well the core.
