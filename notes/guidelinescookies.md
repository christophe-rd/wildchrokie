### Notes on adding guidelines to cookies.
1. In the parent folder of everycookie, make sure to delete all tif images (pre-stiching) **including** the .json file. The only remaining thing in the parent folder should be the folder of the stiching percentage that you want to keep (e.g. **30per**) (Note: in the 30per folder, there should be the stiched image AND the json metadata)
2. Then run cookie_guidelines.py 
3. Select the folder in which all the cookie folders are stored
4. Zoom in on the pit and right click in the center to add guidelines. If you're satisfied, right click again. 
5. If it works, the next image should appear.

This will add guidelines on the images WITHOUT changing the dpi and will rename the image corresponding to the species, replicate and whatever is the name of the folder.
