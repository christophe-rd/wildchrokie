#### ALNINC_SH3_P16_guides
RESAND
Confident but check outer ring year
#### ALNINC_SH4_P2_guides
RESAND
Microscope. Still not sure of outer ring. Same pattern where the 2 outer rings appear to be weak real rings as for GR8 P3 and 11B P3
#### ALNINC_SH4_P15_guides
Confident issh. Double check when measuring
#### ALNINC WM5 B2
Sanding ok
#### ALNINC_GR8A_P5_guides
RESAND
Confident
#### ALNINC G8 P3

####ALNINC HF1 P1:
Same as the others. 2022 growth is likely to be 2023, but setting it as 2022 for consistency for now. 

####ALNINC HF9 P15. 
Only 2 rings. Set as 2022 and 21. 

#### ALNINCÂ SH1 P12
RESAND 3RD ROUND: forgot to resanded it in the 2nd round.
Too many years and commented on a ring that looks like a false ring. Outer ring likely 2023. Also, a lot of rot
Microscoped: checked and not super confident about the rings, but defined false and real are consistent.
#### ALNINC WM1 P1
 RESAND 3RD ROUND: forgot to resanded it in the 2nd round. could just check under microscope also
RESCAN 3RD ROUND

RESAND 3RD ROUND: forgot to resanded it in the 2nd round. check under microscope also
Microscoped.Pretty confident
#### ALNINC_WM_5B_P2
RESAND 3RD ROUND: forgot to resanded it in the 2nd round. check under microscope also
Microscoped: pretty confident
#### ALNINC WM5BP16
RESAND 3RD ROUND
Microscoped: pretty confident.
#### ALNINC_WM8_P1
Confident but  check outer ring year

## BETALL
####BETALL GR9 PNA
RESAND
Really unsure of ring measurements. Lots of potential false rings. 
MICROSCOPE. Still not sure 
#### BETALL_GR_12_P3_guides
Sanding ok
Confident
#### BETALL GR12 P3
RESAND
Really unsure of the rings. Most rings seem to be penatrated by cells. Check with Neil.
Confident
#### BETALL GR9 P3
 RESAND 3RD ROUND
Really hard to call the false rings, but ended up with something pretty confident with microscope.
####BETALL GR12 P1
Not sure of 2020 measurement
####BETALL GR13 P15
Outer ring is probably 2023 growth, and the closest one to the pit is probably 2 years, not one like I scraped it. I did this because the ring is almost non-existent at some angles. 
#### BETALL GR14 P15
Outer ring is probably actually 2022 growth because of how wide it is.
Neil: Is the outer ring 2022 or 2023
4TH ROUND: look up last ring and adjust measurements if not ok.
####BETALL SH2 P6
RESAND
Outer ring is probably actually 2022 growth because of how wide it is.
Microscope: and check with the measured images of the second round to confirm that the measured rings are ok. 
Checked and called 4 rings, not 100% confident but it is what it is.
####BETALL SH4 P3 
RESAND
Outer ring may be false ring
Confident
####BETALL SH5 P6
Good
####BETALL SH9 P6
RESAND
Really hard to tell the false rings. As of what I did now, there is 6 rings that go back to 2015 which would be hard to tell.  
Microscope: check the commented part and verify if it's false. Check while comparing to the snd round measurements. Didn't rename the years yet. Verified and still not sure of the calls. Too many rings.
####BETALL SH9 P9
RESAND
ONLY two measurements for this cookie, as there is a huge knot that could be mistaken for the pit. I selected the "knot" that was the most centered. 
Not sure of anything on this cookie. The bottom line measurements stops at 2018 because it's going through the second knot. Might not be possible to infer anything with this guy. 
Microscope
####BETALL WM8A P12
RESAND
The first ring after the pit is probably false because it's very narrow, but it's well defined, so I am not sure.
Microscope: check the first 2 rings from the center. Ok, confident
####BETALL WM8B P12
For red guideline, measured above the guide as it was directly on a knot
####BETALL WM8 P1
Looks good
#### BETALL_WM8A_P5
RESAND 3RD ROUND:
Second outer ring is not well defined at some places, but I believe it's real. First outer ring is also really thin and not well defined but similar to second one so for consistency, they are both real. Medium confident.
####BETALL WM8D P5
RESAND
Really not sure of false rings.
**Neil:**:
Dont call the first ring around the pit. 
Ignore
Set it to the side. I have two cookies for this one. 
I might not have all the ring measurements for the green line and I am not sure if that is ok because there is a knot. 
Microscope: try to look at all the rings by comparing the ones on the scanned 2nd round. Didn't rename for years.
Pretty confident but not that much
## BETPAP
#### BETPAP_SH1A_P1
Confident
####BETPAP GR5B P2
Outer ring, very likely to be 2023 growth.
####BETPAP GR5A P2
Outer ring, very likely to be 2023 growth.
CHECK GR5A P2 AND 5B BECASUE THEY ARE LIKELY THE SAME THEY are almost identical
####BETPAP HF 16A P6
Outer ring, very likely to be 2022 growth.
####BETPAP HF16 P12
Pit NA, 2017 ring for 1 guide line isn't there. Outer ring likely to be 2022 growth. 
NO PIT. So missiing first year growth ring. 
####BETPAP HF16B P6
Outer ring, very likely to be 2023 growth.

## BETPOP
####BETPOP GR 5A P3
A lot of what appears to be false rings, but not sure. I don't know if outer ring is 2022/2023.
Microscope: check the outer rings to make sure they are false
Looked up. Outer rings appear to be false
#### BETPOP_GR5A_P12
Confident
####BETPOP GR5B P12
Microscope: check the outer rings to make sure they are false. Looked up and will resand.
Microscoped: no reason to exclude outer ring even though looking back it seems false, I did 2 whole rounds of it and it seems like real ring with thin but defined ring boundary.
####BETPOP GR3 P16
Only 4 rings. They are well defined and the cookies is very symmetrical. 
#### BETPOP_GR_5C_P12
Confident but 2 knots.

#### BETPOP HF1 P2
RESAND
The whiteish outer part could be active cambium? However, there would be a ring before it. Outer ring likely to be 2022. Would be too large for 2023. 
Realy not sure of multiple rings because none of them appear to be a strong fal se ring. 
**Neil:**
  - White outer part, active cambium? He would expect a ring boundary. Inner annual density fluctuation.
  - Outer ring 2022 or 2023? 2022        
Microscope: Marked ring probably false but really not sure. 
Did only one guidelines with no years because need to check which ones are real and which ones are false. 
Fairly confident
#### BETPOP HF1 P3
RESAND
MISSING MAY Be HF3 P1 check if that guy is HF3 P1 or the opposite
Microscope: look at all rings and inner ones as well. 
Pretty confident.
#### BETPOP HF P6
Outer ring probably 2022. Pretty sure of the calls. 
4TH ROUND: look up last ring and adjust measurements if not ok.
#### BETPOP GR5 P1
RESAND
Outer ring probably 2023 (entered as 2023). Really hard to tell. 2 very small rings. To double check
**Neil:**
-Micro ring  
-Look at the rings.
. The outer brown ring seems real. But it might have not grown. Perfect sanding and a microscope. 
Could be a spring frost event or some sort. 
Microscope: look at outer ring. Not super confident but i think its a real ring
Fairly confident

####BETPOP GR5B P3
Outer ring probably 2022. Pretty confident of the calls made.
I rescanned this guy, but I didn't remeasure it's rings because I was confident from the first round. 
#### BETPOP GR5 P6
Good

#### BETPOP HF3 P1
Pretty sure
#### BETPOP HF3A P6
Pretty sure
There is another one, that has a rougher cut, maybe the one that was scanned and measured was collected at the end of 2023 GS.
####BETPOP HF4 P9
RESAND
Microscope: too many years and don't know any ring that could be false. Not super confident because goes to 2015...
#### BETPOP WM7 P3
Not sure, because goes to 2015, but sanding is pretty good. 
Microscope. Looked up and will resand.
Microscoped: outer ring not well defined, so called false. Medium confident.
#### BETPOP WM P1
Pretty sure 
#### BETPOP WM7 P2
Pretty confident
#### BETPOP WM7 P6 
RESAND
Confident
#### BETPOP WM7 P9
Pretty sure
General comment: Accross most of the betpop, I notice that the 2 last rings have the same pattern. I think most of them have the traits of a false ring, but I am not sure. I just need to be consistent in how I call these. 
#### BETPOP WM7 P15
not too sure
Microscope. Looked up and will resand.
Resanded and not super confident, but ok. The outer ring and the third are called ot be false.
#### BETPOP WM8 P16
Pretty sure
#### BETPOP WM8 PNA
