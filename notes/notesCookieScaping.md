Notes on cookie 

Started on January 6th 2025. 

I lost all of my previous notes from the cookies before ALNINC HF1 P1

ALNINC HF1 P1:

Same as the others. 2022 growth is likely to be 2023, but setting it as 2022 for consistency for now. 

Onward, all ALNINC for their last ring are set as 2022, but no specific notes are taken for them.

ALNINC HF9 P15. 

Only 2 rings. Set as 2022 and 21. 

ALNINCÂ SH1 P12

Too many years and commented on a ring that looks like a false ring. Also a lot of rot

##### ALNINC SH5 P2

RESCAN

##### ALNINC WM5 P1

RESCAN

###### ALNINC WM1 P1

Check to see if it's the same ALNINC WM P1

BETALL GR12 P3

Really unsure of the rings. Most rings seem to be penatrated by cells. Check with Neil.

Outer ring, probably 2022, but not sure

BETALL GR9 P3

Outer ring likely to be 2023, 

BETALL GR9 PNA

Really unsure of ring measurements. Lots of potential false rings. 

BETALL GR12 P1

Not sure of 2020 measurement

####BETALL GR13 P15
Outer ring is probably 2023 growth, and the closest one to the pit is probably 2 years, not one like I scraped it. I did this because the ring is almost non-existent at some angles. 
#### BETALL GR14 P15
Outer ring is probably actually 2022 growth because of how wide it is.
####BETALL SH2 P6
Outer ring is probably actually 2022 growth because of how wide it is.
I am not sure of the inner rings.
####BETALL SH4 P3 
Outer ring may be false ring
I could resand, quality isn't great.
####BETALL SH5 P6
Good
####BETALL SH9 P6
Really hard to tell the false rings. As of what I did now, there is 6 rings that go back to 2015 which would be hard to tell. 
####BETALL SH9 P9
ONLY two measurements for this cookie, as there is a huge know that could be mistaken for the pit. I selected the "knot" that was the most centered. 
####BETALL WM8A P12
The first ring after the pit is probably false because it's very narrow, but it's well defined, so I am not sure.
####BETALL WM8B P12
Bit know on the right of the image. I marked the rings following the other guide's pattern. 
####BETALL WM8 P1
Looks good
####BETALL WM8D P5
Really not sure of false rings.
####BETPAP GR5B P2
Outer ring, very likely to be 2023 growth.
####BETPAP GR5A P2
Outer ring, very likely to be 2023 growth.
####BETPAP HF 16A P6
Outer ring, very likely to be 2022 growth.
####BETPAP HF16 P12
Pit NA, 2017 ring for 1 guide line isn't there. Outer ring likely to be 2022 growth. 
####BETPAP HF16B P6
Outer ring, very likely to be 2023 growth.
####BETPOP GR 5A P3
A lot of what appears to be false rings, but not sure. I don't know if outer ring is 2022/2023.
####BETPOP GR5B P12
Outer ring probably 2022, but not sure if there is a false ring. 
####BETPOP GR3 P16
Only 4 rings. They are well defined and the cookies is very symmetrical. 
#### BETPOP HF1 P2
The whitish outer part could be active cambium? However, there would be a ring before it. Outer ring likely to be 2022. Would be too large for 2023. 
Realy not sure of multiple rings because none of them appear to be a strong false ring. 
#### BETPOP HF P6
Outer ring probably 2022. Pretty sure of the calls. 
#### BETPOP GR5 P1
Outer ring probably 2023 (entered as 2023). Really hard to tell. 2 very small rings. To double check
#### BETPOP GR5 P6
Good
