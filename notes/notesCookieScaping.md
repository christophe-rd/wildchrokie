#### ALNINC G8 P3

####ALNINC HF1 P1:
Same as the others. 2022 growth is likely to be 2023, but setting it as 2022 for consistency for now. 

**Onward, all ALNINC for their last ring are set as 2022, but no specific notes are taken for them.**

####ALNINC HF9 P15. 
Only 2 rings. Set as 2022 and 21. 

#### ALNINCÂ SH1 P12
Too many years and commented on a ring that looks like a false ring. Outer ring likely 2023. Also, a lot of rot
**Neil**:
- Drop molded cookies?
- Outer ring 2023 or 2022?
#### ALNINC WM1 P1
It's WM1 P1
#### ALNINC WM5BP16
RESAND
MISSING will need to rescan and ressand
#### BETALL_GR_12_P3_guides
Sanding ok
#### BETALL GR12 P3
RESAND
Really unsure of the rings. Most rings seem to be penatrated by cells. Check with Neil.
Outer ring, probably 2022, but not sure
**Neil**:
- Which ones are real? they all seem to be false
#### BETALL GR9 P3
Outer ring likely to be 2023
####BETALL GR9 PNA
RESAND
Really unsure of ring measurements. Lots of potential false rings. 
####BETALL GR12 P1
Not sure of 2020 measurement
####BETALL GR13 P15
Outer ring is probably 2023 growth, and the closest one to the pit is probably 2 years, not one like I scraped it. I did this because the ring is almost non-existent at some angles. 
#### BETALL GR14 P15
Outer ring is probably actually 2022 growth because of how wide it is.
Neil: Is the outer ring 2022 or 2023
####BETALL SH2 P6
RESAND
Outer ring is probably actually 2022 growth because of how wide it is.
I am not sure of the inner rings.
####BETALL SH4 P3 
RESAND
Outer ring may be false ring
####BETALL SH5 P6
Good
####BETALL SH9 P6
RESAND
Really hard to tell the false rings. As of what I did now, there is 6 rings that go back to 2015 which would be hard to tell. 
####BETALL SH9 P9
RESAND
ONLY two measurements for this cookie, as there is a huge knot that could be mistaken for the pit. I selected the "knot" that was the most centered. 
####BETALL WM8A P12
RESAND
The first ring after the pit is probably false because it's very narrow, but it's well defined, so I am not sure.
####BETALL WM8B P12
Bit know on the right of the image. I marked the rings following the other guide's pattern. 
####BETALL WM8 P1
Looks good
####BETALL WM8D P5
RESAND
Really not sure of false rings.
**Neil:**:
Dont call the first ring around the pit. 
Ignore
Set it to the side. I have two cookies for this one. 
Go with tropical rings.
####BETPAP GR5B P2
Outer ring, very likely to be 2023 growth.
####BETPAP GR5A P2
Outer ring, very likely to be 2023 growth.
####BETPAP HF 16A P6
Outer ring, very likely to be 2022 growth.
####BETPAP HF16 P12
Pit NA, 2017 ring for 1 guide line isn't there. Outer ring likely to be 2022 growth. 
####BETPAP HF16B P6
Outer ring, very likely to be 2023 growth.
####BETPOP GR 5A P3
A lot of what appears to be false rings, but not sure. I don't know if outer ring is 2022/2023.
####BETPOP GR5B P12
FALSE
Outer ring probably 2022, but not sure if there is a false ring. 
####BETPOP GR3 P16
Only 4 rings. They are well defined and the cookies is very symmetrical. 
#### BETPOP HF1 P2
RESAND
The whiteish outer part could be active cambium? However, there would be a ring before it. Outer ring likely to be 2022. Would be too large for 2023. 
Realy not sure of multiple rings because none of them appear to be a strong fal se ring. 
**Neil:**
  - White outer part, active cambium? He would expect a ring boundary. Inner annual density fluctuation.
  - Outer ring 2022 or 2023? 2022        
#### BETPOP HF P6
Outer ring probably 2022. Pretty sure of the calls. 
#### BETPOP GR5 P1
RESAND
Outer ring probably 2023 (entered as 2023). Really hard to tell. 2 very small rings. To double check
**Neil:**
-Micro ring  
-Look at the rings.
. The outer brown ring seems real. But it might have not grown. Perfect sanding and a microscope. 
Could be a spring frost event or some sort. 
Friesh in switzerland. 
####BETPOP GR5BP3
Outer ring probably 2022. Pretty confident of the calls made.

Not sure of false rings
#### BETPOP WM7 P6 
RESAND
#### BETPOP WM7 P9
Pretty sure
General comment: Accross most of the betpop, I notice that the 2 last rings have the same pattern. I think most of them have the traits of a false ring, but I am not sure. I just need to be consistent in how I call these. 
#### BETPOP WM7 P15
not too sure
#### BETPOP WM8 P16
Pretty sure
