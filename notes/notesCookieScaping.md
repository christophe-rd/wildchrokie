#### ALNINC G8 P3

####ALNINC HF1 P1:
Same as the others. 2022 growth is likely to be 2023, but setting it as 2022 for consistency for now. 

####ALNINC HF9 P15. 
Only 2 rings. Set as 2022 and 21. 

#### ALNINCÂ SH1 P12
Too many years and commented on a ring that looks like a false ring. Outer ring likely 2023. Also, a lot of rot
#### ALNINC WM1 P1
It's WM1 P1
#### ALNINC WM5BP16
RESAND
MISSING will need to rescan and ressand
#### ALNINC_WM8_P1
Confident but  check outer ring year

## BETALL
####BETALL GR9 PNA
RESAND
Really unsure of ring measurements. Lots of potential false rings. 
MICROSCOPE
#### BETALL_GR_12_P3_guides
Sanding ok
Confident
#### BETALL GR12 P3
RESAND
Really unsure of the rings. Most rings seem to be penatrated by cells. Check with Neil.
Outer ring, probably 2022, but not sure
**Neil**:
- Which ones are real? they all seem to be false
#### BETALL GR9 P3
Outer ring likely to be 2023

####BETALL GR12 P1
Not sure of 2020 measurement
####BETALL GR13 P15
Outer ring is probably 2023 growth, and the closest one to the pit is probably 2 years, not one like I scraped it. I did this because the ring is almost non-existent at some angles. 
#### BETALL GR14 P15
Outer ring is probably actually 2022 growth because of how wide it is.
Neil: Is the outer ring 2022 or 2023
####BETALL SH2 P6
RESAND
Outer ring is probably actually 2022 growth because of how wide it is.
Microscope and check with the measured images of the second round to confirm that the measured rings are ok. 
####BETALL SH4 P3 
RESAND
Outer ring may be false ring
Confident
####BETALL SH5 P6
Good
####BETALL SH9 P6
RESAND
Really hard to tell the false rings. As of what I did now, there is 6 rings that go back to 2015 which would be hard to tell.  
Microscope: check the commented part and verify if it's false. Check while comparing to the snd round measurements. Didn't rename the years yet.
####BETALL SH9 P9
RESAND
ONLY two measurements for this cookie, as there is a huge knot that could be mistaken for the pit. I selected the "knot" that was the most centered. 

Not sure of anything on this cookie. The bottom line measurements stops at 2018 because it's going through the second knot. Might not be possible to infer anything with this guy. 
####BETALL WM8A P12
RESAND
The first ring after the pit is probably false because it's very narrow, but it's well defined, so I am not sure.
Microscope: check the first 2 rings from the center.
####BETALL WM8B P12
Bit know on the right of the image. I marked the rings following the other guide's pattern. 
####BETALL WM8 P1
Looks good
####BETALL WM8D P5
RESAND
Really not sure of false rings.
**Neil:**:
Dont call the first ring around the pit. 
Ignore
Set it to the side. I have two cookies for this one. 
I might not have all the ring measurements for the green line and I am not sure if that is ok because there is a knot. 
Microscope: try to look at all the rings by comparing the ones on the scanned 2nd round. Didn't rename for years.

## BETPAP
#### BETPAP_SH1A_P1
Confident
####BETPAP GR5B P2
Outer ring, very likely to be 2023 growth.
####BETPAP GR5A P2
Outer ring, very likely to be 2023 growth.
####BETPAP HF 16A P6
Outer ring, very likely to be 2022 growth.
####BETPAP HF16 P12
Pit NA, 2017 ring for 1 guide line isn't there. Outer ring likely to be 2022 growth. 
####BETPAP HF16B P6
Outer ring, very likely to be 2023 growth.

## BETPOP
####BETPOP GR 5A P3
A lot of what appears to be false rings, but not sure. I don't know if outer ring is 2022/2023.
####BETPOP GR5B P12
FALSE
Outer ring probably 2022, but not sure if there is a false ring. 
####BETPOP GR3 P16
Only 4 rings. They are well defined and the cookies is very symmetrical. 
#### BETPOP HF1 P2
RESAND
The whiteish outer part could be active cambium? However, there would be a ring before it. Outer ring likely to be 2022. Would be too large for 2023. 
Realy not sure of multiple rings because none of them appear to be a strong fal se ring. 
**Neil:**
  - White outer part, active cambium? He would expect a ring boundary. Inner annual density fluctuation.
  - Outer ring 2022 or 2023? 2022        
#### BETPOP HF P6
Outer ring probably 2022. Pretty sure of the calls. 
#### BETPOP GR5 P1
RESAND
Outer ring probably 2023 (entered as 2023). Really hard to tell. 2 very small rings. To double check
**Neil:**
-Micro ring  
-Look at the rings.
. The outer brown ring seems real. But it might have not grown. Perfect sanding and a microscope. 
Could be a spring frost event or some sort. 
Friesh in switzerland. 
####BETPOP GR5BP3
Outer ring probably 2022. Pretty confident of the calls made.
#### BETPOP GR5 P6
Good
#### BETPOP HF1 P3
RESAND
MISSING MAY Be HF3 P1 
#### BETPOP HF3 P1
Pretty sure
#### BETPOP HF3A P6
Pretty sure
####BETPOP HF4 P9
RESAND
#### BETPOP WM7 P3
Not sure, because goes to 2015, but sanding is pretty good. 
#### BETPOP WM P1
Pretty sure 
#### BETPOP WM7 P3
Not sure of false rings
#### BETPOP WM7 P6 
RESAND
#### BETPOP WM7 P9
Pretty sure
General comment: Accross most of the betpop, I notice that the 2 last rings have the same pattern. I think most of them have the traits of a false ring, but I am not sure. I just need to be consistent in how I call these. 
#### BETPOP WM7 P15
not too sure
#### BETPOP WM8 P16
Pretty sure
#### BETPOP WM8 PNA
RESAND
#### BETPOP HF1 P3
Resand and rescan
#### BETPOP XX P3

#### QUERNA HF19 NA
No replicate number. It's the small one, and I also have the 2 twins from HF19. Also yougest measurement is only the pit
