# 12 May 2025
Notes on visual (and not statistical) crossdating. When tomorrow problems, it's cookies or cores or both that I am really not sure and should not be included in the analysis until I either ask Neil or something comes up where I am more confident of the calls I made. 

## ALNINC
### ALNINC SH1 P12
Only cookie of that species with a core and I have no idea of the years. 

## BETALL
### BETALL GR12 P1 Core? 
Doesn't follow pattern. Changed 2022 to 2023 and it fits the pattern much better. 
### BETALL GR13 P2
Pattern ok. double checked.
### BETALL SH2 P6
Pattern ok. double checked.
### BETALL SH9 P9
We have a cookie and a core, but I am not sure of anything for this cookie. TOMORROW PROBLEMS
### BETALL WM8A P5
Previous note is that cookie 22 is 2023, it makes sense, but the pattern is not perfect. There is a false ring in 2020, that is only visible on the cookie, but not sure enough to call it a true ring. Ok for now

# Cookies without cores
